This java programming project aimed at creating a Server/Client connection using sockets and displaying an interactable UI to the user (Using Swing GUI). 
This UI contains a text box for entering a number and a button for calculating the Fibonacci number of whatever was entered.
The user is expected to enter a number (Negative numbers shutdown the connection). 
Once the user clicks the "Calculate" button, the server will do the calculation for the Fibonacci number based on the input and return that number to the client.
